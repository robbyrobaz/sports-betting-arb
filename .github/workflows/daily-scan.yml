  # NOTE: Scheduled runs are DISABLED because:
  # - GitHub Actions has unreliable 5-minute scheduling
  # - Minimum interval is often 10-15 minutes
  # - Local cron job is more reliable
  # - See: /home/rob/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/sports-betting-scan.sh
  
  # To manually trigger: gh workflow run daily-scan.yml
